/**
 * Discover every ESM module the native V2 entries transitively import from the
 * source tree. The deployed runtime, the activation script, and the isolated QA
 * contracts all copy the same set from this one function, so a newly added
 * module can never be silently dropped by a hand-maintained list (the failure
 * mode that makes the lab runtime fail to import a module after an edit).
 *
 * The native runtime has two entrypoints: the server plugin
 * (`rigel-v2-native.mjs`) and the companion CLI plugin
 * (`rigel-v2-native-cli-notification.mjs`, exported as the package `./tui`).
 * Both roots are walked so the CLI entry's own dependency graph is staged too.
 *
 * Returns repo-forward-slash relative paths, sorted, excluding the entry
 * modules themselves: callers deploy each entry under its own name.
