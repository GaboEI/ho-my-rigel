/**
 * Ordered, failure-isolated rule chain for the native OpenCode V2 tool hooks.
 *
 * The V2 runtime registers ONE handler per `tool.hook` event and V2 awaits that
 * handler serially. `rigel-v2-native.mjs` composes several rules inside each
 * handler: the `execute.after` block (hashline, reminders, category-skill
 * reminder, recovery, rules, comment-checker, plan-format validator, webfetch
 * guard) and the `execute.before` write-guard block (prometheus-md-only,
 * write-existing-file guard, comment-checker, webfetch guard). Before this
 * helper a single rule that threw aborted every later rule in the same event,
 * so one newly added throwing rule could silently disable the whole downstream
 * chain.
 *
 * `runOrderedRules` runs the rules in their declared order, catches a throwing
 * rule into a `{ name, error }` failure, and continues with the next rule. The
 * collected failures are returned at the boundary so the caller decides whether
 * a degraded chain should fail the event or merely be logged; the optional
 * `onError` callback observes each failure as it happens.
 *
 * A rule is either a bare function or a `{ name, run }` object. `run` receives
 * the same `input` the event carried. `name` is used verbatim in the recorded
 * failure; a rule without a name falls back to `rule[index]`. A rule that has
 * no callable function is itself recorded as a failure and does not stop the
 * chain.
