/**
 * Flow-rule registry for the native OpenCode V2 runtime.
 *
 * This module is the single wiring point for the ported OmO flow surfaces. The
 * runtime consumes exactly four ordered collections and nothing else:
 *
 * - `beforeRules`: `tool.execute.before` rules appended after the built-in
 *   write-guard rules. A rule is a `{ name, run }` object; `run` receives the
 *   V2 event object.
 * - `afterRules`: `tool.execute.after` rules appended after the built-in result
 *   transforms.
 * - `requestSteps`: ordered `http.request` rewrite steps composed into the one
 *   existing request hook.
 * - `eventHandlers`: durable V2 event handlers the runtime event loop awaits.
 *
 * Declared order (frozen; the runtime appends, never reorders):
 *
 * before (after the runtime's prometheus-md-only, write-existing-file-guard,
 * comment-checker and webfetch-redirect-guard rules):
 *   1. notepad-write-guard            (throws; isolated by `runOrderedRules`)
 *   2. question-label-truncator
 *   3. sisyphus-junior-notepad
 *   4. fsync-skip-warning:record-start
 *
 * after (after the runtime's hashline/reminders/category-skill/recovery/rules/
 * comment-checker/plan-format/webfetch result transforms):
 *   1. delegate-task-retry
 *   2. fsync-skip-warning
 *
 * request (inside the single `session.hook("http.request")` pipeline, before
 * the keyword/roster seam reads the body):
 *   1. tool-pair-validator
 *   2. stop-continuation-guard
 *
 * `eventHandlers` is empty: no binder contributes an event-driven handler. The
 * background manager is driven imperatively by the runtime's existing event
 * loop, and the keyword/compaction state is fed by that same loop, so the array
 * stays a frozen empty extension point rather than a second subscription.
 *
 * The fsync start rule and the fsync after rule MUST share one tracker, or the
 * after rule cannot drain the skips recorded past that call's start. The
 * default exports below bind the binder's own module tracker; the runtime calls
 * `createFlowRules({ fsyncSkipState })` once in setup so its single tracker is
 * the one cleared on `session.deleted` and on dispose.
