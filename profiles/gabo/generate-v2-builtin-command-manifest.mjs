/**
 * Materializes the four remaining V1 builtin commands as a data-only manifest
 * for the native V2 command editor. The V1 owner is
 * `packages/omo-opencode/src/features/builtin-commands/commands.ts`; this
 * generator imports it directly so the deployed runtime carries the exact V1
 * template bodies (wrapper, team-mode addendum and placeholders included) and
 * cannot drift from the owner.
 *
 * `goal`, `ulw-execute` and `stop-continuation` are intentionally excluded:
 * `goal` and `ulw-execute` are already registered by the native runtime and
 * `stop-continuation` is delivered by the native prompt seam. Registering them
 * here would duplicate an existing command template.
 *
 * Run with Bun, because it imports the V1 TypeScript owner:
 *   bun run profiles/gabo/generate-v2-builtin-command-manifest.mjs
